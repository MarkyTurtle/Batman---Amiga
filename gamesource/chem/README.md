# Level 1 - Axis Chemical - Music & SFX

This project contains the disassembled code for the Music & SFX player for the Level 1 - Axis Chemicals level.

I have added a test program that will initialise and play the level music from VSCode.

Just load the project into VSCode and build and run the project to hear the Level 1 music.

Future development will include more reverse engineering of the music/sfx data format and also a better test program to select the tunes/sfx from a menu.
